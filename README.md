## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `Data` - Contains the data used for the project
- `Models` - Contains the models created for the project
- `Notebooks` - Contains the Jupyter Notebook file for the project
- `README.md` - The README file for the project
- `requirements.txt` - The file containing the required packages and libraries for the project

## Setting up the Virtual Environment (Optional)

To set up the virtual environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check by running the following command:

    ```shell
    python --version
    ```

2. Create a new virtual environment using the `venv` module. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
    
3. Activate the virtual environment. Run the correct command based on your OS:

    - For Windows:

      ```shell
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - For macOS and Linux:

      ```shell
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the required packages and libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

After making sure all the dependencies are installed whether you decide to use a virtual environment or not.

1. Open the Models Folder 

2. In the folder you will find 4 files, each of which are the models we created for this project. 

3. To run the models, open the files in a Python IDE and run the code.

4. In the Notebooks Folder, you will find the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for the models as well.

Note: The KNN model takes a while to run, so be patient. Also the Decision Tree model also creates a txt file of the tree.
