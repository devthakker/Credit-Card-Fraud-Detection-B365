This is the README file for the B365-Course-Project repository on Classifications For The Fraudulent Credit Card Charges.

## Setting up the Virtual Environment (Optional)

To set up the virtual environment for this project, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can check by running the following command:

    ```shell
    python --version
    ```

2. Create a new virtual environment using the `venv` module. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    python -m venv myenv
    ```
    
3. Activate the virtual environment. Run the correct command based on your OS:

    - For Windows:

      ```shell
      myenv\Scripts\activate
      ```

    - For macOS and Linux:

      ```shell
      source myenv/bin/activate
      ```

4. Install the project dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    This will install all the required packages and libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Usage

After making sure all the dependencies are installed whether you decide to use a virtual environment or not.

1. Open the Models Folder 

2. In the folder you will find 4 different models, each with their own respective jupyter notebook.

3. Open the notebook you wish to run and run all the cells.

4. The notebook will output the accuracy of the model and the confusion matrix.

Note: The KNN model takes a while to run, so be patient. Also the Decision Tree model also creates a txt file of the tree.
